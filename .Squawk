1. Code Duplication & Consistency
- The logic for reading UI inputs, validating parameters, performing customer lookup, and launching the worker thread is highly duplicated across invoice_actions.py, sales_receipt_actions.py, charge_actions.py, and transaction_actions.py.

2. Monitoring Action Shadowing & Import
- The local function name conflicts with the imported action creator, leading to poor readability and potential errors.
- monitor_actions.py | The function set_expected_deposit_account(app) shadows the imported action creator set_expected_deposit_account from store. Also contains a redundant inner import.
- Rename/Clean: Rename the function to handle_set_expected_deposit_account(app) to prevent shadowing and remove the redundant from store import set_expected_deposit_account as set_account_action line inside the function body.

3. Efficiency: O(N) Lookups (Medium Priority)
- Looking up Terms and Classes by iterating through a list every time a transaction is created is inefficient and clutters the action code.
- Implement mapping for cleaner lookup/retention
